# Django Practice Projects

## Introduction

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Shivam Mali, a passionate developer who loves exploring web development, especially using Django! This repository contains a collection of Django practice projects that I've built as part of my learning journey. Each project focuses on different aspects of Django and aims to strengthen my skills in web application development. 

Most of these projects were inspired by tutorials and guidance from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/django-projects/), an invaluable resource for learning Django and other programming concepts.
